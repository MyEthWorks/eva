Random notes and thoughts.

Eva wishlist
============

- Client topology aware? Allow users to switch clients and continue same conversation
- Command: "Analysis - What prompted that response?"
- Command to playback last interaction/conversation
- Command to repeat the last response or repeat the last question
- Command: "Diagnostics" gives a health status
- Command: Sleep / mute. Should also work with a scheduled day of week/hour of day and a timer
- Command for history search - when did I last ask you about X. Search history for the first/last occurence/question involving Y
- Allow for spelling or words using letters or maybe Alpha/Bravo/Charlie/etc
- Allow for tokens for words that can't be recognized easily
- Use speech recognition module for clients instead of pyaudio directly
- Translate plugin (translates text/audio from one language to another)
- Implement intent system (adapt.mycroft.ai)
- Support other intent/conversation services like wit.ai, api.ai, and amazon lex
- Technical notifications plugin (error logs, network traffic, low disk space, etc)
- The user should only need to tag or speak to a client about where it is and Eva will remember it's tag/location
