Random notes and thoughts.

Eva wishlist
============

- Client topology aware? Allow users to switch clients and continue same conversation
- Command: "Analysis - What prompted that response?"
- Command to playback last interaction/conversation
- Command to repeat the last response or repeat the last question
- Command: "Diagnostics" gives a health status
- Command: Sleep / mute. Should also work with a scheduled day of week/hour of day and a timer
- Command for history search - when did I last ask you about X. Search history for the first/last occurence/question involving Y
- Allow for spelling or words using letters or maybe Alpha/Bravo/Charlie/etc
- Allow for tokens for words that can't be recognized easily
- Have a on_unload() or similar function to on_load() which should do clean-up tasks for disabled plugins
- Some way of getting status on apscheduler jobs
- Use speech recognition module for clients instead of pyaudio directly
- Crossplatform Desktop UI client
- Translate plugin (translates text/audio from one language to another)
- Implement intent system (adapt.mycroft.ai)
- Support other intent/conversation services like wit.ai, api.ai, and amazon lex
- Proper voice activity detector (VAD) (py-webrtcvad)
- Dockerized default_stt?
- Technical notifications plugin (error logs, network traffic, low disk space, etc)
- Allow clients to receive commands from Eva for things like calibrating audio/listening threshold, muting, sending audio specific to client, etc
- Eva should keep track of what clients are sending it audio data and have a way of labeling them and refering to them with the user
- The user should only need to tag or speak to a client about where it is and Eva will remember it's tag/location
- Be able to explicitly request that responses only go to a certain client that's Eva-aware
