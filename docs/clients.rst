Eva Clients
===========

You may also run a native Python client to communicate with Eva. Two options are provided in this repo:

    - A simple CLI client (not voice-enabled): `python3 clients/remote_cli.py`
    - A simple voice client (experimental): `python3 clients/headless.py`

Note: You will need the appropriate dependencies to run the clients - if you're running Eva with Docker, you'll have to do a `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
